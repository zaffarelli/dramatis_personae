At first, it was an undercover activity, the goal of the clockmaker being to reproduce golem having the shape of humans, but bearing no real sentiance. What Ratugas achieved at this time with his apprentice was to make dolls having at best the temper of a domesticated dog. This was the first generation. They needed to be tamed, or educated, as they have no natural feral state, to be able to do simple tasks, like carrying water in the desert. The first batch of automats that made the Brotherhood famous in the Empire was a special unit, the white faces, used on Stigmata, deployed with equipment and weapons and going through enemy lines without being detected, passing for dead if they attracted the attention of the symbiots. This was a great success and the emperor saw a great interest in a technology that would allow to resist the symbiots.
