    description: "=The Merchants of Hope=\r\nAs soon as you get to the inner belt\
      \ of the Byzantium Secundus system, you can easily become a prey of the Merchants\
      \ of Hope. Those guilders, usually working out of the League juridiction, add\
      \ a substantial amount of money by selling to travellers (preferabilly outworlders)\
      \ exactly what they need with a 10 percent *special newcomer discount*. \r\n\
      \r\nMost of the time, they will try to do repairs in space to avoid authority,\
      \ asking to the victims to send their technical log and to meet at a rendez-vous\
      \ point on the *Novgorod Shipyards*. A few minutes after, they cancel the rendez-vous,\
      \ arguing that the problem is more critical than expected and not fixing it\
      \ now could lead to important failures.\r\n\r\nThey try \"not to smoke twice\
      \ the same cigar\", and never try to hit a second time on a victim, successful\
      \ or not.\r\n\r\nµFamous Membersµ\r\n* ¤jetty_colona¤. Scraver boss. The 50\
      \ something scraver captain is a pro. She usually uses holovid hacking to appear\
      \ as a young officer. Her actor studio approach to the job makes her successful\
      \ 80 percent of the time. Her hacks can be detected with two successfull rolls:\
      \ AWA|sensors|20 and TECH|think machine|25.\r\n\r\nµModus Operandiµ\r\nThe typical\
      \ MO for their team is to hack through communications from starships asking\
      \ for help on the planetary support channel. From there, they do a quick search\
      \ on the owner of the ship and who might be leading it. Once done, if the ship\
      \ has no link to local authority or mob, they check their database to quickly\
      \ provide the perfect device to fix the problem. \r\n\r\nµDogoodersµ\r\nCapturing\
      \ Merchants of Hope members is more valuable to league than imperial authority.\
      \ The typical reward for a MoH member captured alive is 250 £birds. The amount\
      \ can be x2 to x5 according to the member captured, and will be x2 when delivered\
      \ to guild officials.\r\n\r\nµIf the PC buy hardware to them...µ\r\n* The hardware\
      \ they sell may be stolen from guild storage (6 of 12)\r\n* It may have serious\
      \ defects (3 of 12)\r\n* In rare occasion, due to some lack of knowledge, a\
      \ very reliable device is acquired (1 of 12)"

    description: "=Master Balthazar Theodore Zemeckis=\r\nThe whole epic is built\
      \ around one character, Master ¤balthazar_zemeckis¤ of the POE. He is a highly\
      \ qualified engineer whose speciality is clockworking, the art of building automats.\r\
      \nOne could easily assume that such a carrier domain might be totally inapropriate\
      \ in the empire for many reasons, but, like his master £Olem Ratugas£ before\
      \ him, he worked his path through power groups and the Church to ensure that\
      \ none might easily harm his business.\r\nIn 4982 AD, Radugas founded the High\
      \ College of the Clockwork, based at first on Istakhr. At first, it was an undercover\
      \ activity, the goal of the clockmaker being to reproduce golem having the shape\
      \ of humans, but bearing no real sentiance. What Ratugas achieved at this time\
      \ with his apprentice was to make dolls having at best the temper of a domesticated\
      \ dog. This was the first generation. They needed to be tamed, or educated,\
      \ as they have no natural feral state, to be able to do simple tasks, like carrying\
      \ water in the desert. The first batch of automats that made the Brotherhood\
      \ famous in the Empire was a special unit, the white faces, used on Stigmata,\
      \ deployed with equipment and weapons and going through enemy lines without\
      \ being detected, passing for dead if they attracted the attention of the symbiots.\
      \ This was a great success and the emperor saw a great interest in a technology\
      \ that would allow to resist the symbiots. The Church did not officially sanctioned\
      \ the brotherhood, but an Act from the Patriarch, £Lex Automata£ was dispatched\
      \ in the high instances of the Church when the white faces helped the rescue\
      \ of the first Manifest Light platoon.\r\n\r\n=Clockworking Inner Council=\r\
