      sanctuary deep in the forest. You don't need to walk all along to the maw, but
      a fair number of milestones have to be reached by foot. From the §Li Quan§,
      the village in the Black Dragon Den, the Walk of Reverence is 1200 km and can
      take 4 monthes with a vehicle.

    resolution: '¤giorgio_masseri¤ has been killed by ¤eva_lise_decados¤. The are
      not that many hints about that, except a finger print on a bottle and a second
      glass on a table that leads to think the killer was a woman Giorgio knew.


      She used the window of the room recently prepared for Fenton to minimize her
      efforts.


      µThe Mantis and the Starµ

      There is one thing that Eva Lise wants from Giorgio: his ¤Manticore ¤


      µThe Legacyµ

      Giorgio was not that close to his family. He barely knew Fenton, and has a few
      encounters with ¤clara_masseri¤. He was genuinely fond of them, but the distance
      between his calm and the rage of Clara, especially on the subject of the future
      of the House always kept a rift between them.


      He knew he won''t escape Eva-Lise, so he put into motion a way to achieve a
      long term association he had with ¤bertram_van_gelder¤. Thus, he sold most of
      his assets, except his house, to try to buy Gerald Van Gelder Cutlass, for an
      exchange with Bertram: the last jumpkey to the lost world of Verona, once the
      land of the Masseri. He wrote a letter to Clara after the auction, containing
      a chip with enough to understand to contact Bertram. The last one, knowing about
      the issue of the auction, has planed to come to visit Giorgio anyway.



      §Notes§

      - Only a few people, among whom Clara, know that Giorgio has his right eye cybernetically
      improved to record video.

      them via the Van Dyke Cartel. He will use his best enforcers to assist the Van

    description: 'µBack to the AgathisµThe Agathis is a piece that the Vanderen Cartel
      wants to obtain at all cost. As soon as it is releases from the hands of the
      Decados, allies of the Vanderen Cartel, Members of the Invisible Path will launch
      an action to take the relic.

      µThe Invisible PathµHowever, the occultists will quickly realize what use can
      be made of the Agathis, and schism will grow quickly between conservatives and
      activist members that will luckily break the status quo inside the coven, with
      the current director of the Coven, ¤elias_rastenberg¤ having to deal with rebels
      activists lead by the bold ¤farad_ashara¤. Few people actually know about the
      presence of the coven in south Veneto, except for ¤larusso_van_gelder¤, the
      famous chameleon assassin, and ¤fiona_denguerrand¤, Minister of External Affairs
      of the Black Dragon Den  and actual leader of the Favyana Coven based in the
      Den.'
    resolution: 'µFavyanaµHaving heard of the event and its circumstances, Fiona will
      try to join the players as soon as possible. Of course, evoking directly what
      she is involved with is not something that she will do, and if she cannot figure
      out there''s an occultist among the player, she will push on the neutrality
      of ¤larusso_van_gelder¤ either to get closer to the character (he won''t charge
      her for that) or to be her ambassador if the things are getting trickier.

      µInvisible SchismµDuring the attack of the Orthodox Guards in the Cathedral,
      twelve of them were killed by the covenant. This will cause a lot of doubt about
      the players credibility if they try to open lines of communication with those
      murderous heretics.

      Actually, the members of the Invisible Path have return to their hidden shelter
      in Rudolph, but fearing for the consequences of their act, a bold move but totally
      missing insight, Elias has decided to fire them. Of course, he let them go with
      the Agathis, but he as them closely watched by ¤kyoko_zee_mai¤, a neutral occultist
      close to ¤irene_de_glacemer¤, that will help him out of preserving the tranquillity
      of §Rudolph§.

      µThe DissidentsµThe two other dissidents are ¤owen_calabra¤ and ¤mythra_standfill¤.

      µConsequencesµ Activity with the invisible path will bring attention from the
      §Kalinthi§, and ¤arlan_secato¤ will try to establish communication lines with
      the players.'

      \ profile approach.\r\nµReaching the Groundµ\r\nThis operation is a really tough\
      \ one, and can only be done only by the best pilots. \r\n- The Hellcloud (20%\
      \ of the trip), the higher layer of the atmosphere can disable all systems at\
      \ any time if the ships goes through a node (electro magnetical node, source\
      \ of terrible lightning bolts). A navigation check is needed every hour at §DV\
      \ 24§ to avoid one, and it takes §five hours§ to go through this layer the §safe\
      \ way§. An attempt can be made if §going straight§ is an option, it takes only\
      \ §one hour§ but §3 checks§ must be made at §DV 26§. \r\nA failed check will\
      \ damage the ship like a §standard medium blaster§ gun shot.\r\n- With winds\
      \ reaching 500 km/h in the middle layer, the Purgatory, (between 20% and 70%\
      \ of the trip), manoeuvre checks are needed every 30 minutes to avoid drifting\
      \ to a solid obstacle (can be liquid water/hailstorm or a solid body part of\
      \ the rings of Verona). The moons of Verona are actually at the 30%, 45% and\
      \ 69% of the atmosphere. Two are obstacle that should be avoided and solid bodies\
      \ that create gravity wells also, but the biggest at 69% can be detected from\
      \ the Hellcloud and could have a slingshot effect if its gravity well is crossed\
      \ from too close.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The upper layer (70% to 71%) is liquid water.\
      \ If not handled correctly it can be a terrible impact at contact.\r\nThe best\
      \ way to reach the ground of Verona is by using an escape pod. House Masseri\
      \ has a few that had been modified to handle the length of the trip."

      \ another platform. Superprinted indications show the move you have to do, and\
      \ both contestants must synchronize.\r\nThe roll to handle this is a contested\
      \ ~AWA+Performance (Dancing)~ between the participants. Current champion of\
      \ the discipline is Crafter ¤alicia_bregen¤, who will enjoy wearing her §cloaking\
      \ suit§(*) when contesting against a man (+4 to her). \r\n\r\n(*) §This special\
      \ suit is invisible to the sensors. It is setup to remove just the suit, not\
      \ the wearer of the suit (one can easily guess this might be the first purpose\
      \ of such a vestment).§\r\n\r\nµStone to Flesh shotsµ\r\nA specialty of the\
      \ house, this special cocktail, also called §Medusa's Gaze§ is based on lemon\
      \ and a special desert snake venom, the §White Arshic§. Not lethal once distilled\
      \ like this, it has the property to freeze the muscular and nervous system of\
      \ the drinker for one second ~CON+Athletics/DV 15~, with a fresh burst sensation.\
      \ \r\n\r\nThe §White Arshic Extract§, when not used with lemon has the same\
      \ effects for a duration from one to ten minutes, then putting the subject to\
      \ sleep for as many hours. It can be lethal on a botched resistance roll (negative\
      \ score). This extract can be acquired at §Apothecary Ramladan Suq§ in the Bazaar\
