    description: 'The dervishes present in Miret are not authorized to be there, but
      they did not come without a purpose. ¤saskia_varnovicz¤ knows secrets, and one
      of them came to the ears of ¤irene_de_glacemer¤ and ¤annizze_rolas_de_hazat¤.
      Usually Decados secret deserves them, but this time both ladies agreed that
      supporting the grafina was a necessicity.

      While Irène would lead the operations to unveil the spies for the Kurgan Caliphate
      in the Empire, or at last in Miret and Veneto, Annizze would provide a strike
      force to fight the Kurgan invaders.'
    resolution: µUnveiling the secretµ From allies she has in the Pandemonium system,
      veterans of the Kurgan War, Saskia learned that there is in Veneto a jumpkey
      that could link the Rampart and Sargasso systems. The key was taken twenty years
      ago by the Decados, and copied with the help of a Charioteer Loge and House
      D'Rouge-Glace. Three copies were made before the Avestites lead a raid to the
      facility, destroying the master key and the shelter as well. Strangely, an important
      number of avestites died during the raid when the building collapsed. A copy
      of the key was taken by a kurgan spy, ¤yussuf_meknes¤, one other by ¤fergus_rouge¤
      for the sake of his master ¤sigmeon_drougeglace¤.

      \ to recover second republic material from a local cult, the Mozïm Velcar brotherhood.\n\
      \nThe cultists are convinced they have found a set of Elixir. As they are not\
      \ allowed to use it, they want to sell it for a good price. \n\nThere are 20\
      \ bottles of elixir in a locked hyper glass chest, among 30 unidentified bottles.\
      \ They want 30£ per elixir bottle, and don't care about the other bottles, for\
      \ a total of 600£. \nThey never opened the chest and don't know how it can be\
      \ opened (Tech+Security DV 20 Roll with Volt Tools, multiple attempts can be\
      \ chained, each attempt is 15 min long in a lab, 1 hour in the country)."
    resolution: The real price for the content of the chest are the 30 bottles of
      EDYE (Elixir of Longevity), worth 800£ apiece. All the Elixir bottles are okay,
      but one of the EDYE bottles is spoiled (AWA + Alchemy DV 25 from outside to
      see that, has the content of the bottle seems to bear a lower viscosity).
